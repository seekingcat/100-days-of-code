### Day 4: May 26, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
* Reviewed Callbacks and Array Methods in WDB
* Worked on Section 25 - DOM Events in WDB

**Thoughts** Thinking that as I'm moving forward I should set up a healthy habit of reviewing what I've gone over so I don't keep piling knowledge on top of shaky knowledge.
Gone over array Methods like .forEach(), .map(), .filter(), .reduce(), .some(), .every(). Reviewed arrow functions and writing implicit returns, as well as the keyword *this* and its quirks in arrow functions.
