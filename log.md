### Day 4: May 24, 2024

**Today's Progress**:

* Reviewed Callbacks and Array Methods in WDB
* Worked on Section 25 - DOM Events in WDB

**Thoughts** Thinking that as I'm moving forward I should set up a healthy habit of reviewing what I've gone over so I don't keep piling knowledge on top of shaky knowledge.
Gone over array Methods like .forEach(), .map(), .filter(), .reduce(), .some(), .every(). Reviewed arrow functions and writing implicit returns, as well as the keyword *this* and its quirks in arrow functions.
Section 25 of WDB - lessons 259 - 266. event listening and handling

### Day 5: May 25, 2024

**Today's Progress**:

* Reviewed different types of event handling - mouse, keyboard, form
* Did event handling exercises to consolidate understanding of the different workflows, eg single page workflows

Went over the use of the keyword *this* and their use in event handling, they can be used to denote the element being acted upon when used as a separate callback and called in an event. Looked at pointer events, keyboard events and form events. Looked at preventing forms from submitting to another page, so that you can manipulate the data on a single page. Looked at capturing keyboard locations or keyboard key values using e.code and e.key. 

**Thoughts**: The lessons took a little time to implement, so I had to work slowly today over a section that I had previously completed but I think it's worth the time to consolidate the knowledge because this will be fundamental understanding for manipulating large data forms or APIs later on in the course. I think the concepts are starting to crystalise in my head but I just struggle with remembering all the syntax. I think that it will only become second nature the more I use the syntax

### Day 7: May 26, 2024

**Today's Progress**:

* Change events and input events
* Event bubbling
* Event delegation

**Thoughts**: Started working on the scorekeeper exercise without coding along, hoping that I was able to crack it without help from the instructor. Got stopped at the very first step trying to initialise a counter. This seems the simplest thing and I'm rather frustrated that I can't seem to get this to work. I get the first counter to work, but when I click the button for the second counter to start at 0, the second counter just picks up from where the first counter has left off rather than starting from 0. I know this is because I've initialised the counter outside of a function, but when I try to put it into a function so I'm not duplicating my code, it doesn't seem to work, the counter goes up by one then stops. This is so easy and I know it is, so I can't believe I was stuck right at the very beginning. But at least I was able to click to change my spans in my scorekeeper and I was able to reset each span with a reset button. i'm also able to add classes to each element on a button click so that's at least some progress. Frustrated.
